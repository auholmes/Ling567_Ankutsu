Grammar Clean-Up:

We had several pronouns in our grammar that differed only by emphasis or formality. We removed these to include only one pronoun for each PERNUM feature.

We had prop-or-ques for all of our sentences. We had to modify semi.vpm to handle input questions:

SF : SF
  prop <> prop
  prop-or-ques << ques
  prop-or-ques >> prop-or-ques
  prop << prop-or-ques
  comm <> comm
  * <> *

We modified semi.vpm to handle tense as well.

E.TENSE : TENSE
  nonfuture <> nonfuture
  future <> future
  nonfuture << past
  nonfuture << present
  nonfuture << [e]


We had tense underspecified for all nonfuture verbs, so we created the following lexical rules:

tense-lex-rule-super := add-only-no-ccont-rule & constant-lex-rule &
  [ INFLECTED [ TENSE-FLAG +,
                ASPEC-OR-NEG1-OR-THEME-FLAG #thm,
                POSS2-FLAG #poss2,
                POSS1-FLAG #poss1 ],
    DTR tense-rule-dtr &
        [ INFLECTED [ ASPEC-OR-NEG1-OR-THEME-FLAG #thm,
                      POSS2-FLAG #poss2,
                      POSS1-FLAG #poss1 ] ] ].

nonfinite-verb-lex-rule := tense-lex-rule-super &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.FORM nonfinite ].

nonfuture-verb-lex-rule := tense-lex-rule-super &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL [ CONT.HOOK.INDEX.E.TENSE nonfuture,
                   CAT.HEAD.FORM finite ] ].

When we tried to translate the sentence, "Dogs eat" into Akuntsu, we realized that the lexical entry for "ko" (eat) was a transitive verb. Thus, we implemented argument optionality to make it work as both a transitive and an intransitive verb.

tato ko
dog eat
Dogs eat

We created the following lexical types:

no-obj-drop-verb-lex := transitive-verb-lex &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.VAL.COMPS.FIRST.OPT - ].

obj-drop-verb-lex := transitive-verb-lex &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.VAL.COMPS.FIRST.OPT + ].

We also enabled the head optional comp rule.

When we tried to translate the sentence "Dogs chase cars and cats chase dogs", we discovered that we were losing information in the MRS. 

tato takÉ¨rap poka   ameko tato poka
dog  car     chase  cat   dog  chase
Dogs chase cars and cats chase dogs

Thus, we fixed the sentence coordination rules as follows:

unary-bottom-coord-rule :+
  [ C-CONT.HOOK.LTOP #ltop,
    ARGS.FIRST.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.LTOP #ltop ].

s1-top-coord-rule := basic-s-top-coord-rule & apoly-top-coord-rule &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL [ CAT.HEAD.FORM #form,
                   COORD-STRAT "1" ],
    LCOORD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.FORM #form,
    RCOORD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.FORM #form ].

s1-bottom-coord-rule := unary-bottom-coord-rule & s-bottom-coord-phrase &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL [ CAT.HEAD.FORM #form,
                   COORD-STRAT "1",
                   COORD-REL.PRED "_and_coord_rel" ],
    ARGS < [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.FORM #form ] > ].

We did not implement any transfer rules.

There are several reasons why we are getting multiple translations for sentences:

 - Asyndetic Coordination
 - We have two subj-head rules to account for SOV and OVS word order.
 - Thematic Vowel

Additionally, the following sentences do not have translations:

I think that you know that dogs chase cars
I ask whether you know that dogs chase cars
Dogs eat quickly
What do you think the dogs chase
Who asked what the dogs chase
I asked what the dogs chased
The dog sleeps because the cat sleeps
The dog sleeps after the cat sleeps

The source we were working from did not provide enough information to model these phenomena.

The following three sentences are not translating (but they were yesterday). It looks like the PERNUM information is not being passed correctly in the MRS, but we ran out of time to finish debugging.

Dogs eat
The dogs dont chase cars
Hungry dogs eat

The following sentences did not translate since there was a bug with possessives.

The dog s car sleeps
My dogs sleep

The following sentence does not parse with the Pite Saami grammar (and thus does not translate into Akuntsu).
Maon haosaoklav duv

The following sentences do not translate:
Bednaga eh haoskaolao bijlajd
Bednaga haoskaoli bijlajd ja gaahto haoskaoli bednagajd
Gaahto haoskaoli bednagajd ja urri
Bednaga bijjla aorraa
Muv bednaga urri

The final two sentences have the same problem with possessives we had in English.

Baseline Coverage: 86.4%
Baseline Overgeneration: 10.3%
Baseline Ambiguity: 5.67

Updated Coverage: 86.4%
Updated Overgeneration: 24.1%
Updated Ambiguity: 7.47%

We created some overgeneration by allowing "ko" (eat) to act as both transitive and intransitive. We had (incorrectly) created ungrammatical examples with "ko" as an intransitive verb.
