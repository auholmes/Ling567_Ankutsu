Grammar Clean-Up:

We had several pronouns in our grammar that differed only by emphasis or formality. We removed these to include only one pronoun for each PERNUM feature.

We had tense underspecified for all nonfuture verbs, so we created the following lexical rules:

tense-lex-rule-super := add-only-no-ccont-rule & constant-lex-rule &
  [ INFLECTED [ TENSE-FLAG +,
                ASPEC-OR-NEG1-OR-THEME-FLAG #thm,
                POSS2-FLAG #poss2,
                POSS1-FLAG #poss1 ],
    DTR tense-rule-dtr &
        [ INFLECTED [ ASPEC-OR-NEG1-OR-THEME-FLAG #thm,
                      POSS2-FLAG #poss2,
                      POSS1-FLAG #poss1 ] ] ].

nonfinite-verb-lex-rule := tense-lex-rule-super &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.FORM nonfinite ].

nonfuture-verb-lex-rule := tense-lex-rule-super &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL [ CONT.HOOK.INDEX.E.TENSE nonfuture,
                   CAT.HEAD.FORM finite ] ].

When we tried to translate the sentence, "Dogs eat" into Akuntsu, we realized that the lexical entry for "ko" (eat) was a transitive verb. Thus, we implemented argument optionality to make it work as both a transitive and an intransitive verb.

tato et
dog sleep
Dogs sleep

We created the following lexical types:

no-obj-drop-verb-lex := transitive-verb-lex &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.VAL.COMPS.FIRST.OPT - ].

obj-drop-verb-lex := transitive-verb-lex &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.VAL.COMPS.FIRST.OPT + ].

We also enabled the head optional comp rule.

When we tried to translate the sentence "Dogs chase cars and cats chase dogs", we discovered that we were losing information in the MRS. 

tato tak…®rap poka   ameko tato poka
dog  car     chase  cat   dog  chase
Dogs chase cars and cats chase dogs

Thus, we fixed the sentence coordination rules as follows:

unary-bottom-coord-rule :+
  [ C-CONT.HOOK.LTOP #ltop,
    ARGS.FIRST.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.LTOP #ltop ].

s1-top-coord-rule := basic-s-top-coord-rule & apoly-top-coord-rule &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL [ CAT.HEAD.FORM #form,
                   COORD-STRAT "1" ],
    LCOORD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.FORM #form,
    RCOORD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.FORM #form ].

s1-bottom-coord-rule := unary-bottom-coord-rule & s-bottom-coord-phrase &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL [ CAT.HEAD.FORM #form,
                   COORD-STRAT "1",
                   COORD-REL.PRED "_and_coord_rel" ],
    ARGS < [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.FORM #form ] > ].

We did not implement any transfer rules.

There are several reasons why we are getting multiple translations for sentences:

 - Asyndetic Coordination
 - We have two subj-head rules to account for SOV and OVS word order.
 - Thematic Vowel
