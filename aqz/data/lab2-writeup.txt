Ling 576 - Lab 2
Audrey Holmes and Aycha Edwards
Language: Akuntsu
Write-up by Audrey Holmes

Word order in Akuntsu is primarily SOV with some variation to OVS or VO(S). Here are some examples: 

Examples 1 and 2 show a grammatical SOV sentence an an ungrammatical SVO sentence.

# Word Order Example 1
Source: a:198
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: word order
Tʃaɾuj  kɨjtpit	õ-a   
Tʃaruj 	fish 	give-THV
Tʃaruj 	gave 	fish

# Word Order Example 2

Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: word order
Tʃaɾuj 	õ-a kɨjtpit  
Tʃaruj 	give-THV fish
Tʃaruj 	gave 	fish

Example 8 shows a grammatical OVS sentence, which does not parse due to the constraints of the customization system.

ɨkɨ apeka poɾakɨ

In the customization system, we chose SOV because it is the most common word order for the language and the customization system was not flexible enough to model special cases for OVS and VO(S). We will dig deeper into this in future labs.

Akuntsu has seven independent pronouns: 1s, 2s, 3s, 1pl inclusive, 1pl exclusive, 2pl, and 3pl.

Here are some examples:

# Pronoun Example 5

Judgment: g
Vetted: f
Phenomena: pronouns
otʃe et-a
1PL.EXCL sleep-THV
we sleep

# Pronoun Example 7
Source: author
Judgment: g
Vetted: f
Phenomena: pronouns
kejat et-a
3PL sleep-THV
they sleep

The lexical entries for each of these pronouns has a pernum feature that takes one of the following values: 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 1p-incl, 1p-excl.

Akuntsu does not have case, gender, or determiners.

Akuntsu has two tenses: future and non-future. Here are some examples:

e Example 1
Source: author
Judgment: g
Vetted: f
Phenomena: tense
on ko  kɨjtpit kom 
1S fish inguest PROJ 
I will eat fish

# Tense Example 2
Source: author
Judgment: g
Vetted: f
Phenomena: tense

e Example 3
Source: author
Judgment: u
Vetted: f
Phenomena: tense
on ko kom kɨjtpit 
1S fish PROJ inguest

The future tense is denoted by a projective marker (PROJ). 

Tense was not included in the starter grammar for this lab.

Akuntsu has several aspects including iterative, reduplication, and habitual. Here are some examples:

# Aspect Example 1

Judgment: g
Vetted: f
Phenomena: aspect
en boja-ɾa kɨp

# Aspect Example 5

3PL	go-RED

# Aspect Example 7

The habitual and iterative aspects are marked by affixes. In reduplication, the verb or part of the verb is repeated.

Aspect was not included in the starter grammar for this lab.

Several types of WH-questions occur in Ankutsu. They include what, where, when, and who. The interrogative words occur at the beginning of the sentence.

# Wh question Example 1
Source: author
Judgment: g
Vetted: f
Phenomena: wh question 
taɾa te ko
what 2S eat
What did you eat?

# Wh question Example 1

Judgment: g
Vetted: f
Phenomena: wh question 
aɾop kit ko
who seed eat
Who ate the seed?

WH-questions were not included in the starter grammar for this lab.

The coverage for the test suite was 33.3% with no over-generation.

There were no sentences that parsed when they shouldn't have. However, there were several sentences that didn't parse when they should have. The most common reason for this was that the parser didn't recognize some of the words in the lexicon. For example, kɨjtpit. This is likely do to special characters in the word. We will look into this...

The following example didn't parse because the word 'apeka' was missing from the lexicon. However, it also shouldn't have parsed because the phenomenon was not covered in the starter grammar! That is, it is OVS, an exception to the more typical SOV word order.
