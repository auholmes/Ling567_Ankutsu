Ling 576 - Lab 3
Aycha Edwards and Audrey HolmesLanguage: AkuntsuWrite-up by Aycha Edwards

Word order in Akuntsu is primarily SOV with some variation to OVS or VO(S). Examples 1 and 2 show a grammatical SOV sentence and an ungrammatical SVO sentence. Example 8 shows a grammatical OVS sentence, which does not parse due to the constraints of the customization system.

UPDATE from Lab2:
In Akuntsu, when the agent occurs post-verbally, it is due to the fact that the patient is the main topic of the conversation. Focus markers may or may not appear, depending on the semantics of the proposition.

Here are some examples:

In the customization system, we chose SOV because it is the most common word order for the language and the customization system was not flexible enough to model special cases for OVS and VO(S). We will dig deeper into this in future labs.

Akuntsu has seven independent pronouns: 1s, 2s, 3s, 1pl inclusive, 1pl exclusive, 2pl, and 3pl.

UPDATE from Lab2:
In the grammar matrix we listed under the Number category that Akuntsu has the Singular Feature and the Plural Feature, while under the Person category it has the First, Second and Third values and first person plural has the subtypes of inclusive and exclusive.
 
Here are some examples:

# Pronoun Example 7

Judgment: g
Vetted: f
Phenomena: pronouns
kejat et-a
3PL sleep-THV

The lexical entries for each of these pronouns has a pernum feature that takes one of the following values: 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 1p-incl, 1p-excl.

Akuntsu does not have case, gender, or determiners.
 
Akuntsu has two tenses: future and non-future. 

UPDATE from Lab2: Tense marker “kom” was entered in the lexicon and morphology sections of the grammar matrix as a suffix that come after the verb to mark the future tense, while its absence marks non-future tense and its marked by no affix. 

Here are some examples:

Akuntsu has several aspects including iterative, reduplication, and habitual.

UPDATED from Lab2:
The habitual and iterative aspects are marked by suffixes that go after the verb.

Here are some examples:

# Aspect Example 1

Phenomena: habitual
en boja-ɾa kɨp
2S cut-HAB woodyou cut wood

3S ITER sleep-THVHe sleeps continuously

# Aspect Example 5

In reduplication, the verb or part of the verb is repeated.

Here are some examples:

3PL go-RED

UPDATE from Lab2:
Ankutsu has Wh-questions, but does not have Wh-words that express an argument of an embedded verb such as in English “I thought she did what she was told.” Below are grammatical and ungrammatical examples of Wh-questions with “What” and “Who” in Akuntsu. 
# Wh question Example 1

Negation in Akuntsu has two markers. The fist marker is the suffix “eɾom” which can be modified to “ɾom” if the verb ends in vowel or “om” if the verb is monosyllabic and end in “t”. The second marker is the “nõm” which comes before the verb.

Akuntsu does not have Agreement, Coordination, or Agreement in coordinated NPs.

There were only two example of attributive adjectives in Akuntsu. Both illustrate that these types of adjectives come after the verb. Below are some examples.

# Attributive adjectives Example 1

# Attributive adjectives Example 2

There was only one example of adverbs in Akuntsu. Which is illustrated in the examples below. It is instantiated by duplication, so it is hard to know if adverbs in the language all behave like that or if there are other markers to indicate adverbs. Adverbs where not part of the grammar matrix for this lab.
